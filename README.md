# 24-points-calculator

24 points calculator in python

* no limit on the size of numbers (even floats)
* the goal can also be adjusted, not necessarily 24
* repetitive solutions and redundant parentheses are removed
* only works for 4 numbers' calculation

**Usage**: Input 4 numbers in four lines and solutions will be printed.

**Example**:

```
Number 1:3
Number 2:3
Number 3:7
Number 4:7
7*(3+(3/7))
1 solutions in total.


Number 1:3
Number 2:8
Number 3:4
Number 4:6
(8-6/3)*4
6/(3/(4+8))
(8+4)*6/3
(8/4+6)*3
3*4*(8-6)
6*((8+4)/3)
(4*3-8)*6
(8-6)*3*4
(4+8)/(3/6)
(8+4)*(6/3)
10 solutions in total.
```

**To be improved**:

* check invalid input
* add game mode, e.g., play with computer
