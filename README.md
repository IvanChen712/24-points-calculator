# 24-points-calculator

24 points calculator in python

This program only works for 4 numbers' calculation.

**Usage**: Input 4 numbers. Solutions will be printed.

**To be improved**:

* redundant parentheses
* redundant solutions when two swaps are involved, e.g.,`7*(3+(3/7))` and `((3/7)+3)*7`
* add game mode, e.g., play with computer
